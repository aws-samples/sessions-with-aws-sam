# HTTP API direct integration example

This template demonstrates using the new HTTP APIs direct integration to an Amazon SQS queue, a Kinesis Data Stream, and the default EventBridge bus. The following resources are built:
* SQS Queue
* Kinesis Data Stream
* HTTP API
* IAM Role for HTTP API
* A Lambda function for testing.

The *api.yaml* file contains the OpenAPI definition for the direct integration.

## Deployment
From this folder run:
```bash
sam deploy -g
```

## Testing
Update the '\<url\>' with your URL after deployment

### SQS
```bash
curl --location --request POST '<url>/sqs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"MessageBody":"This is my message"}'
```

### EventBridge
```bash
curl --location --request POST '<url>/eb' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"Detail": {"First Name": "My first name"}}'
```

### Kinesis
```bash
curl --location --request POST '<url>/kinesis' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"Data": "Here is the data"}'
